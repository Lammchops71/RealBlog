Hello reader, 

I'm glad you have taken the time to navigate my blog and check out the about me page. I am a Division 1 NCAA athlete at Mercyhurst University majoring in Business Intelligence and Finance with a minor in Information Technology. I find data science extremely fascinating, and I hope together we can conquer any data problem that comes our way.

Cheers!
