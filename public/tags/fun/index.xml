      <description>Welcome back to Data Scientology. Today we will be looking at how to create a time series plot on some Babe Ruth’s HR career homerun totals.
First, like always, we must upload necessary libraries needed to perform the time series function. The three libraries we need are as follows:
library(Lahman) library(sqldf) library(ggplot2) Next, we must execute a query to extract the data we want to create a time-series plot on. We want each year Babe Ruth played in the MLB and we also want his homerun totals.</description>

      <description>Let’s create a histogram that analyzes the body weight distribution of all MLB baseball players.
First, we must upload the three necessary libraries needed to perform the histogram function. These three include the Lahman, sqldf, and ggplot2 libraries.
library(Lahman) library(sqldf) library(ggplot2) Second, we must execute a query to extract the data for all MLB players’ weight.
# extracting the data query&amp;lt;-&amp;quot;SELECT weight FROM Master&amp;quot; result&amp;lt;-sqldf(query) Next, we want to write a “ggplot” function that will allow us to create the histogram and visualize the data.</description>
